Westeros
========

Westeros is a MediaWiki skin which is heavily based on the Oasis/FandomDesktop skin by Fandom, but also takes elements from the PCGamingWiki's Overclocked skin. The skin works with the most recent versions of MediaWiki (tested with 1.38+) but may also work with earlier versions, although this is not guaranteed. 

### Notable Features
* Navigation bar that can be changed on the wiki, this is located at `MediaWiki:Westeros-navigation`;
* Responsive header that collapses into a hamburger menu on window resize (see note below);
* Header capabale of supporting images or colours, much like the Oasis skin before the migration to FandomDesktop. 

### Notes
Some elements are hard-coded for the Whiki Platform, such as the global header. Adapting may be tricky as this bit also contains the personal links such as log in, contributions, etc. One may circumvent this by hiding the logo (`#p-logo`) and then changing the colour of the navbar to their liking or making it transparent. One may also need to change the font from `Mike Sans Regular` to fit their liking. 

### Credits

* Inspiration borrowed from Overclocked and Oasis/FandomDesktop Skins;
* Navigation bar borrowed from the Gamepress Skin.
